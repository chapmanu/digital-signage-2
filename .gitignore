# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

config/secrets.yml

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore backup databases
/db/backups

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

/public/uploads/*

.env

# Change for change's sake. (To revive red-hat-playbook branch.) You can delete this in future.
